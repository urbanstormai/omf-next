# OMF Next.js Project Context

## Latest Task Summary
Completed maximum logo prominence, modern 2025 Hero design, and compact viewport-optimised layout for the OMF mortgage landing page. Implemented maximum navbar height (h-28) with logo size h-24 (96px) and dimensions 600x200px for approximately 4cm width coverage, creating strong brand presence. Enhanced Hero section with modern system-ui font stack, increased font sizes and weights for bold typography, changed dots to full stops ("Onshore.Offshore.Overseas."), proper spacing (pt-40) from taller navbar, and glossy CTA button with charcoal text and enhanced glass effect. Created compact glass cards that fit in viewport without scrolling by reducing size (p-8 to p-4), icons (h-12 to h-6), text (text-xl to text-sm), removing detailed descriptions, and keeping only essential phrases ("FCA Regulated", "Fast Approval", "Overseas Experts"). Moved CTA button up (mb-24 to mb-12) and reduced grid spacing for optimal viewport fit. Fixed webpack import errors and maintained responsive design with smooth animations. All feedback addressed: larger logo, black navbar background, modern fonts, full stops instead of dots, readable glossy CTA, enhanced glass effects, and compact cards that fit without scrolling.
